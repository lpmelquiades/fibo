# fibo

Here is the technical testðŸ¤“:
Part of our cryptographic mechanism (used to protect users' personal information)
is based on numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
When putting our systems into production we noticed a serious
performance degradation when Fibonacci numbers 100 and higher were required.

Investigating, we arrive at the function that calculates it. It is transcribed below:

function fibonacci($count){
	if($count == 0 || $count == 1){
		return 1;
	} else {
		return fibonacci($count - 1) + fibonacci($count - 2);
	}
}

#> Solution:
	1- Explanation of why this happens (Most technical possible).
		
		When the 'function fibonacci' is invoked, a certain amount of memory is allocated until the 'function fibonacci' finishes.
		However, the 'function fibonacci' is invoking two instances of itself.
		This behavior produces an exponential memory allocation -- complexity of O(2^n).
		The job responsable by the 'function fibonacci' is probably running out of memory.  


Solution with complexity of O(n).	
function fibonacci($count) {
	$a = 0;
	$b = 1;

	$i = 0;
	while ($i < $count) {
	    $i++;
	    $next = $a + $b;
	    $a = $b;
	    $b = $next;
	}
	
	return $b;
}
		
	
2- Create an API with the solution (It should run in a container).

	1- Repository with the API.
